- Designed and prototyped a program to run analyses directly on edge devices using TensorFlow to reduce turnaround times (by 38%) and alleviate the need for internet access
- Built a distributed job scheduling cluster to optimize resource utilization during the training of deep neural networks over large volumes of medical image data cutting cloud costs by 40%
- Responsible for scaling the in house distributed, deep learning platform built on TensorFlow and Apache Spark through improvements to the architecture, data partitioning strategies and readability.
- Redesigned the platform as an ecosystem of python packages each supporting a different use case (analysis, training, data processing)
- Architected and implemented a data access layer to act as an abstraction between applications requesting data from multiple cloud providers distributed as clients in multiple languages (python, javascript) with a unified interface to interact with a central server.
- Streamlined development by deploying and maintaining a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for core projects and publishing a backbone/guideline for future projects
