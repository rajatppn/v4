Hello! I'm Rajat, a graduate student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, New York.

I enjoy solving alogrithmically complex problems, in general I enjoy taking on work that challenges me.

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/) in 2015, after which I worked in the Industry building distributing systems and data pipelines for startups for almost 4 years.
I currently study at [Stony Brook University, New York](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) where I work with the Computational Geometry group, advised by [Prof. Joseph Mitchell](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~jsbm/jsbm.html).
My research interests lie in algorithm design, computational geometry, graph design and game theory.

Here are a few technologies I've worked on over the course of my career:
